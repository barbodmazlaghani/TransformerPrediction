Approach: we used momentary data, old data augmentation and only 80-drivers dataset to predict momentary fuel consumption and then use cumsum of that.
Main Goal: we had some challenges with LSTM models, we tried this approach to see if we have a improvement or not.
Result: Overall prediction improved, but sensivity decreased in momentary prediction.
